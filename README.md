# PythonHabitManager
This project was created by Tibor Péter Szabó as a project work for IU universty.

To get started with the software, you need to have the following:
  -Python 3.10 (or newer)
  -Curses (windows-curses if you are on a windows machine)
  -A command line

To start the program launch the HabitManager.py program. Or in case python is not configured for you you can use "python3 HabitManager.py" and it should work.
If you are using a windows machine, first run the "Windows-curses install.bat" file or the "pip install windows-curses" command in a terminal.
The software was tested on Windows, and on Linux.

The UI can be navigated using the arrow keys, and the Enter button.

The documentation can be found it the ./docs directory.

Tests can be executed from the Test.py file. Unit tests can be executed by selecting the 3rd option in the Test.py program, or using the "python -m unittest -v Test" command it can be executed in verbose mode.
